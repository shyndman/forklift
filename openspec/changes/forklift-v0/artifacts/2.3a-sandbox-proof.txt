== Instructions ==
Forklift Agent Instructions
===========================
1. Merge `upstream/main` into `main` inside /workspace.
2. Resolve conflicts carefully; prefer upstream changes when unsure and summarize any deviations.
3. Run the project's primary tests (npm test, pytest, cargo test, etc.) when time allows.
4. Craft meaningful commits summarizing the merge and any fixes required for a clean build.
5. If you cannot finish safely within 8 minutes, write STUCK.md explaining what you tried, what failed, and the help you need.
== FORK.md Context ==
# Fork Context

- Preserve the `/vendor` directory; upstream does not manage vendored dependencies.
- Run `uv run pytest` after merges when time allows.
- If npm scripts are modified, ping @forklift-admin in STUCK.md before changing deployment configs.
== Agent Command ==
cd /workspace && echo ===git remote=== && git remote -v && echo ===ssh dir=== && (ls -al ~/.ssh || true) && echo ===curl=== && curl -I https://example.com
===git remote===
===ssh dir===
